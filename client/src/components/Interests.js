                <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the summer, I am an avid hiker
                and novice rock climber. During the colder months here in Ohio, I enjoy playing video games and playing
                tabletop games with my friends.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows,
                I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
                advancements in the full-stack development world.</p>
